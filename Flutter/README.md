The **Flutter Doctor** will check if you are ready to start developing in 5 different platforms and if a smartphone is connected.

**Platform IDEs-**
- **Microsoft Windows**
- **Android toolchain**
- **Android Studio**
- **IntelliJ**
- **Visual Studio Code**

If you see that any of the section is not checked or has a red x, follow the instuctions provided to install into which ever platoform you wish to develope on.

For this project, we will be developing on **Visual Studio Code**. Most likely Flutter Doctor will indicate that **Visual Studio code** is not ready for Flutter development. We will need to download an extension.

## Flutter Extension for Visual Code
